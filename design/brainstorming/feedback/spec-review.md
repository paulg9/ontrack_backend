# prompt: review how well my Feedback specification fits the provided docs, as well as this blurb from the assignment instructions:

<refactoring concepts>
Refactoring your concepts. Until now, you have been defining concepts in the abstract. In this assignment, as you implement and test your concepts, they will become more concrete and you will more easily be able to see any flaws. You should therefore take this opportunity to refactor your concepts as you see fit, taking into account feedback you received on the design assignment, and evolving them as you work. You should pay particular attention to correcting these common flaws:

Composite objects. Make sure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB). Composite objects should be used only inside concept implementations and never exposed.
Conflation of concerns. Make sure that your concepts separate concerns, and that each one embodies only one concern and does not conflate multiple, unrelated concerns. You may want to review the lectures on modularity if you are not confident that you understand this idea.
Data structures. A concept that is nothing more than a data structure without any interesting behavior is suspect, and is usually a sign that the data structure should have been incorporated into another concept.
Dependencies. Make sure that your concepts are fully independent. There should be no function calls between concepts, and no reference in one concept to the database state of another concept.

# response:

Let's break down your `Feedback` concept specification against the provided documentation and the refactoring guidelines.

Overall, the `Feedback` concept is a good attempt, demonstrating an understanding of the core principles. However, there are several areas, particularly regarding concept independence, action result types, and how syncs interact with concept state, that need refinement to fully align with the concept design methodology.

---

### General Adherence to Documentation

1.  **Concept Name & Type Parameters**:
    *   **Observation**: `concept Feedback` is given. The state and actions refer to `User` and `CheckIn` (implied by syncs and principle).
    *   **Doc Alignment**: The documentation states "The concept section gives the *name* of the concept, and a list of *type* *parameters*. These type parameters are for the types of objects that are created externally to the concept..."
    *   **Recommendation**: You should explicitly declare external types as parameters.
        ```diff
        - concept Feedback
        + concept Feedback [User, CheckIn, Schedule] // Or Time for the scheduler aspect
        ```

2.  **Purpose**: "Compute and deliver habit-forming feedback and reminders from check-ins"
    *   **Doc Alignment**: Need-focused, specific, and evaluable.
    *   **Assessment**: This is excellent. It clearly states the *why* and *what* from a user-centric perspective.

3.  **Principle**: "As the athlete logs check-ins, the system computes streaks and completion rates; at a configured reminder time, if the day’s check-in is missing, send a reminder"
    *   **Doc Alignment**: Goal-focused, differentiating, and archetypal.
    *   **Assessment**: Very good. It tells a clear story that demonstrates the concept's value and distinguishes it from simpler tracking.

4.  **State**:
    *   `a set of Summaries with owner User, streakCount Number, completion7d Ratio`
    *   `a set of Messages with owner User, timestamp DateTime, kind {reminder, motivation, summary}, text String`
    *   **Doc Alignment**: Represents relationships and partitions the data model.
    *   **Assessment**: Good. It avoids the "composite objects" trap within its *internal* state representation, treating `User` as an identifier for relationships.

5.  **Actions**:
    *   **`recompute (owner: User, today: Date) : (summary: Summary)`**:
        *   **Problem**: Returning `(summary: Summary)` as a result. The refactoring guidelines explicitly warn against composite objects in arguments/results, implying that actions should return primitive values or *identifiers* (like a MongoDB document ID). The sync `motivateOnImprovement` then accesses `summary.streakCount`, which confirms `summary` is being treated as a composite object result, not just an ID.
        *   **Recommendation**: Change the return type to explicitly provide the calculated metrics and the summary identifier.
            ```diff
            - recompute (owner: User, today: Date) : (summary: Summary)
            + recompute (owner: User, today: Date) : (summaryId: Summary, newStreakCount: Number, newCompletion7d: Ratio)
            ```
            The `effects` clause should be updated to reflect this.
    *   **`recordMessage (owner: User, kind: Enum, text: String) : (msg: Message)`**:
        *   **Problem**: Similar to `recompute`, `(msg: Message)` as a composite object return is problematic.
        *   **Recommendation**: Return the message identifier.
            ```diff
            - recordMessage (owner: User, kind: Enum, text: String) : (msg: Message)
            + recordMessage (owner: User, kind: Enum, text: String) : (messageId: Message)
            ```
            Update `effects` accordingly.
    *   **`sendReminder (owner: User)`**:
        *   **Problem**: The `requires` clause has strong dependencies: `now.time ≥ owner.reminderTime; no CheckIn exists for (owner, today)`. This directly accesses properties of an external `User` concept (`owner.reminderTime`) and queries the state of an external `CheckIn` concept. This violates the core principle of concept independence: "Each concept is defined without reference to any other concepts, and can be understood in isolation." and "Because concepts are fully independent of one another, they cannot refer to each other or use each other's services."
        *   **Recommendation**: The `sendReminder` action should be simpler. The *conditions* for sending a reminder (e.g., user's reminder time, missing check-in) should be evaluated by the *sync* that triggers this action, and the `sendReminder` action itself would just take `owner` (and perhaps the message to send if `Feedback` doesn't fully compose it internally) as arguments.
            ```diff
            - sendReminder (owner: User)
            -   requires owner exists; now.time ≥ owner.reminderTime; no CheckIn exists for (owner, today)
            + sendReminder (owner: User) // System action
            +   requires owner exists
            +   effects delivers a reminder (out-of-band) for owner and records a reminder Message
            ```
        *   **Completeness of functionality**: The `effects` clause "delivers a reminder (out-of-band)" is consistent with the "completeness of functionality" principle – `Feedback` *is* the notification mechanism for its specific purpose, rather than calling out to a generic `Notification` concept for *delivery*.

6.  **Queries**:
    *   **Observation**: No explicit queries are defined for `Feedback`.
    *   **Doc Alignment**: "Explicit query specifications are often not used at the design level, but in specifications of concepts for code all queries that are likely to be needed should be specified." The `weeklySummary` sync *implies* a query into `Feedback`'s state.
    *   **Recommendation**: Define queries for any data that external syncs or other parts of the application need to read from `Feedback`'s state. For example:
        ```
        // In Feedback Concept, add a 'queries' section
        queries
          _getSummaryMetrics (owner: User): (streakCount: Number, completion7d: Ratio)
            requires owner exists
            effects returns the owner's current streakCount and completion7d from their Summary.

          _hasSentReminder (owner: User, date: Date): (sent: Boolean)
            requires owner exists
            effects returns true if a reminder was sent to owner on 'date', false otherwise.
        ```

7.  **Syncs**: This section has the most significant issues related to dependencies and composition.
    *   **`motivateOnImprovement`**:
        *   **Problem**: `Where summary.streakCount` and `text: "Nice work — streak " + summary.streakCount + " days!"` directly access fields of the `summary` object returned by `recompute`. This reinforces the composite object problem.
        *   **Recommendation**: If `recompute` is refactored to return `(summaryId, newStreakCount, newCompletion7d)`, then this sync becomes clean:
            ```diff
            * motivateOnImprovement
            -   When Feedback.recompute (owner, today) : (summary)
            +   When Feedback.recompute (owner, today) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
            -   Where summary.streakCount
            +   Where currentStreak > 0 // Or whatever condition for "nice work"
            -   Then Feedback.recordMessage (owner, kind: motivation, text: "Nice work — streak " + summary.streakCount + " days!")
            +   Then Feedback.recordMessage (owner, kind: motivation, text: "Nice work — streak " + currentStreak + " days!")
            ```
    *   **`dailyReminder`**:
        *   **Problem**: `When time.reaches (User.reminderTime)` is not idiomatic. `When` clauses should trigger on explicit actions from concepts (e.g., `Time.tick` or `Schedule.fire`). Directly referencing `User.reminderTime` in `When` implies either a direct call or a problematic binding. Also, `Where user: User` is ambiguous in how `user` is bound.
        *   **Recommendation**: This sync needs to gather all conditions from different concepts using the `in Concept: property of object is value` syntax in the `Where` clause. This implies other concepts (e.g., `User` for `reminderTime`, `CheckIn` for `hasCheckIn`) would exist and provide necessary queries or state properties.
            ```diff
            - * dailyReminder
            -   * When time.reaches (User.reminderTime)
            -   * Where user: User
            -   * Then Feedback.sendReminder (owner: user)
            + * dailyReminder
            +   * When Schedule.hourlyTick (currentDateTime: DateTime) // Assuming a recurring system tick action
            +   * Where
            +       in User: user of u, reminderTime of u is rTime // Get user's reminder time from User concept
            +       currentDateTime.time is after rTime // Check if current time is past reminder time
            +       in CheckIn: hasNoCheckIn (user: u, date: currentDateTime.date) // Assume CheckIn concept provides a query for missing check-ins
            +       in Feedback: hasNotSentReminder (owner: u, date: currentDateTime.date) // Use the new Feedback query
            +   * Then Feedback.sendReminder (owner: u)
            ```
            (Note: `currentDateTime.time`, `currentDateTime.date` imply a way to extract parts of the datetime, which is reasonable.)
    *   **`weeklySummary`**:
        *   **Problem**: `Where user: User` is vague. More importantly, `text: "Weekly: " + Feedback.Summary(owner).completion7d*100 + "% complete."` directly queries `Feedback`'s state in the `Then` clause using a function-like call. `Then` clauses should trigger actions, not perform complex state reads for string concatenation.
        *   **Recommendation**: As with `motivateOnImprovement`, `recompute` should return the necessary data.
            ```diff
            * weeklySummary
              * When calendar.endsWeek (date: Date) // Assuming `calendar` is a concept that triggers end-of-week
              * Where user: User // This implies the sync iterates for all users or the `When` action provides a user context.
              * Then Feedback.recompute (owner: user, today: date) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
              * Then Feedback.recordMessage (owner: user, kind: summary, text: "Weekly: " + currentCompletion*100 + "% complete.")
            ```

### Refactoring Concepts Blurb Analysis

1.  **Composite objects**:
    *   **Issue**: Yes, the return values `(summary: Summary)` and `(msg: Message)` are likely composite objects. The usage in syncs (e.g., `summary.streakCount`) confirms this.
    *   **Correction**: As recommended above, actions should return identifiers and primitive values.

2.  **Conflation of concerns**:
    *   **Issue**: `Feedback` computes metrics, records messages, and sends reminders. This set of responsibilities, given the concept's purpose, seems coherent. It's not conflating unrelated user management (authentication, profiles) or general notification channel management. The "delivers a reminder (out-of-band)" implies it fully handles *this specific reminder type*, which aligns with "completeness."
    *   **Assessment**: This concept likely avoids conflation of concerns as currently defined.

3.  **Data structures**:
    *   **Issue**: `Feedback` clearly has interesting behavior (computing, sending, recording) beyond just storing data.
    *   **Assessment**: This flaw is avoided.

4.  **Dependencies**:
    *   **Issue**: This is the most significant flaw.
        *   `Feedback.sendReminder` directly queries `User.reminderTime` and `CheckIn` state in its precondition.
        *   Syncs directly accessing properties of action *results* as composite objects or performing direct function-like queries (`Feedback.Summary(owner).completion7d`) instead of relying on action returns or explicit query actions.
    *   **Correction**: All dependencies must be mediated by syncs (for cross-concept action triggers and `Where` clause conditions) or by passing data as explicit arguments to actions, or by the concept maintaining its own synced-in copy of relevant external state.

### Conclusion

Your `Feedback` concept has a strong foundation with a clear purpose and principle. The primary areas for refactoring involve stricter adherence to concept independence by:

1.  **Eliminating composite objects** from action arguments and results, returning only identifiers and primitive types.
2.  **Removing direct external state queries** from action preconditions.
3.  **Restructuring syncs** to gather all necessary conditions from external concepts using `Where` clauses (e.g., `in Concept: property of object is value`) and pass explicit arguments to `Then` actions, rather than performing arbitrary queries or field accesses within the `Then` clause itself.
4.  **Defining explicit queries** within `Feedback` for any data that external syncs or UI components need to read.

By addressing these points, your `Feedback` concept will be more modular, reusable, and robust, fitting better into the concept design paradigm.

# prompt: ok, make your fixes and give a new spec

# response:

Okay, let's refactor the `Feedback` concept based on the review and guidelines. The primary focus will be on ensuring independence, avoiding composite objects in action arguments/results, and correctly structuring syncs to mediate dependencies.

Here is the revised `Feedback` concept specification:

---

## Refactored Concept: Feedback

**concept** Feedback \[User, CheckIn]

**purpose** Compute and deliver habit-forming feedback and reminders from check-ins

**principle** As the athlete logs check-ins, the system computes streaks and completion rates; at a configured reminder time, if the day’s check-in is missing, send a reminder.

**state**
  a set of Summaries with
    owner User
    streakCount Number
    completion7d Ratio
    lastReminderDate Date // To prevent multiple reminders on the same day

  a set of Messages with
    owner User
    timestamp DateTime
    kind {reminder, motivation, summary}
    text String

**actions**

*   recompute (owner: User, today: Date) : (summaryId: Summary, newStreakCount: Number, newCompletion7d: Ratio)
    **requires** owner exists
    **effects**
        upserts owner’s Summary;
        sets its streakCount to `newStreakCount` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
        sets its completion7d to `newCompletion7d` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
        returns the ID of the updated/created Summary along with the computed streak and completion values.

*   recordMessage (owner: User, kind: Enum, text: String) : (messageId: Message)
    **requires** owner exists
    **effects**
        appends a new Message for `owner` with the given `kind` and `text` at the current timestamp for audit/tracking;
        returns the ID of the new Message.

*   **system** sendReminder (owner: User)
    **requires** owner exists
    **effects**
        delivers an out-of-band reminder to `owner`;
        records a reminder Message for `owner`;
        updates `owner`'s Summary to set `lastReminderDate` to today's date to track that a reminder was sent.

**queries**

*   _getSummaryMetrics (owner: User) : (streakCount: Number, completion7d: Ratio)
    **requires** in Feedback: Summary of owner exists
    **effects** returns the `streakCount` and `completion7d` from the `owner`'s Summary.

*   _hasSentReminderToday (owner: User, date: Date) : (sent: Boolean)
    **requires** in Feedback: Summary of owner exists
    **effects** returns `true` if the `owner`'s `lastReminderDate` in their Summary is `date`, `false` otherwise.

**syncs**

*   computeFeedback
    **when** CheckIn.submit (owner: User, date: Date, /* other check-in args */)
    **where**
      in CheckIn: _calculateStreak (user: owner, tillDate: date) is calculatedStreak // Assumes CheckIn concept provides a query for calculating streak
      in CheckIn: _calculateCompletion7d (user: owner, tillDate: date) is calculatedCompletion // Assumes CheckIn concept provides a query for calculating 7-day completion
    **then** Feedback.recompute (owner: owner, today: date) : (summaryId, newStreakCount, newCompletion7d)
    **then** newStreakCount is calculatedStreak
    **then** newCompletion7d is calculatedCompletion

*   motivateOnImprovement
    **when** Feedback.recompute (owner, today) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
    **where** currentStreak > 0
    **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: owner, kind: motivation, text: "Nice work — streak " + currentStreak + " days!")

*   dailyReminder
    **when** Schedule.hourlyTick (currentDateTime: DateTime) // Assumes a `Schedule` concept providing hourly ticks
    **where**
      in User: user of u, reminderTime of u is rTime // Assumes `User` concept has a `reminderTime` property for `User` entities
      currentDateTime.time is after rTime.time // Comparing only the time component
      currentDateTime.date is todayDate
      in CheckIn: _hasCheckIn (user: u, date: todayDate) is false // Assumes `CheckIn` concept has a query to check for check-ins
      in Feedback: _hasSentReminderToday (owner: u, date: todayDate) is false
    **then** Feedback.sendReminder (owner: u)

*   shareOpen
    **when** User.createShareLink (user: User) : (token: String) // Assumes `User` concept for share link creation
    **where** token exists
    **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: user, kind: summary, text: "Share link created; weekly summary visible via link.")

*   weeklySummary
    **when** Calendar.endsWeek (weekEndDate: Date) // Assumes a `Calendar` concept that triggers at week end
    **where** user: User // This implies the sync iterates for all relevant users, or `Calendar.endsWeek` provides context
    **then** Feedback.recompute (owner: user, today: weekEndDate) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
    **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: user, kind: summary, text: "Weekly: " + currentCompletion*100 + "% complete.")

### Summary of Changes and Rationale:

1.  **Concept Type Parameters**: Added `[User, CheckIn]` to explicitly declare the external types `Feedback` works with.
2.  **`recompute` Action**:
    *   Changed return type from `(summary: Summary)` to `(summaryId: Summary, newStreakCount: Number, newCompletion7d: Ratio)`. This adheres to the rule of returning identifiers and primitive values, not composite objects.
    *   Updated effects to reflect this change and clarified that computations occur *outside* the `Feedback` concept, with results passed in (this aligns with independence).
3.  **`recordMessage` Action**:
    *   Changed return type from `(msg: Message)` to `(messageId: Message)`. Same rationale as `recompute`.
4.  **`sendReminder` Action**:
    *   Removed all external state dependencies (`owner.reminderTime`, `no CheckIn exists`) from its `requires` clause. The `requires owner exists` remains, as `User` is a type parameter, and `Feedback` needs to ensure the ID is valid in its own context.
    *   Marked as `system` action.
    *   Added `lastReminderDate` to `Summary` state and updated `sendReminder` to use it to track reminders. This enables `Feedback` to internally manage reminder history, a necessary part of its "completeness."
5.  **Queries**: Added `_getSummaryMetrics` and `_hasSentReminderToday` queries to `Feedback`. These are essential for syncs to read relevant data from `Feedback`'s state without direct access or problematic function calls.
6.  **Syncs**:
    *   **`computeFeedback`**: Now passes the calculated `streak` and `completion` values as explicit arguments, assuming `CheckIn` (or another concept) has queries like `_calculateStreak` and `_calculateCompletion7d`. This fully separates the *computation* of these metrics from their *storage* by `Feedback`.
    *   **`motivateOnImprovement`**: Updated to use the named primitive returns (`currentStreak`) from `recompute`, resolving the composite object access issue.
    *   **`dailyReminder`**: Significantly refactored.
        *   The `When` clause now uses a generic `Schedule.hourlyTick` action, decoupling `Feedback` from knowing *when* to check.
        *   The `Where` clause explicitly gathers all necessary conditions (user's reminder time from `User`, absence of check-in from `CheckIn`, and if a reminder was already sent from `Feedback` itself) using `in Concept: ...` syntax and the new queries. This ensures full independence.
    *   **`weeklySummary`**: Updated to use the named primitive returns (`currentCompletion`) from `recompute` in the `Then` clause for constructing the message string.

These changes make the `Feedback` concept much more independent, modular, and consistent with the concept design principles.

# prompt: give a paragraph summary of what was changed from the original.
# response:

The original `Feedback` specification was refactored to more strictly adhere to the principles of concept design, primarily by enforcing complete independence and eliminating composite objects from action interfaces. The most critical change involved moving the complex conditional logic for triggering a reminder out of the `sendReminder` action's precondition and into the `where` clause of the `dailyReminder` sync. This ensures that the `Feedback` concept itself has no direct knowledge of or dependency on the state of other concepts like `User` or `CheckIn`. Additionally, actions like `recompute` were modified to return primitive identifiers and values (e.g., `summaryId`, `newStreakCount`) instead of composite objects, which simplifies the consuming syncs. Finally, explicit queries were added to provide a formal, controlled way for syncs to read `Feedback`'s state, and internal state was added to make the concept more behaviorally complete.
