# prompt: For my Checkin concept, what do I need to test? Give a list of tests I need for full coverage, adhering to testing-concepts as well.
# response:

To ensure full coverage for the `CheckIn` concept, we need to test its principle, the `submit` action (including all its preconditions and effects), and the `amend` action (likewise). We'll adhere to the concept testing guidelines by demonstrating requirement satisfaction/failure and effect confirmation, along with legible output.

Here's a comprehensive list of tests needed:

### **Explanation of Test Coverage:**

1.  **Principle Fulfillment (`trace:`):**
    *   **Goal:** Directly demonstrate the concept's core story as defined in its `principle`.
    *   **Scenario:** A user first `submit`s a check-in, and then `amend`s it. This validates the fundamental flow and ensures both actions work together to fulfill the purpose.
    *   **Verification:** After each action, the state is queried to confirm the effects match expectations.

2.  **`submit` Action Tests:**
    *   **Successful Submissions (Effects):**
        *   Test with minimal required fields (ensures defaults or optional fields are handled correctly).
        *   Test with all fields, including optional `comment` and `completedItems`.
        *   **Verification:** Query the concept state after each `submit` call to confirm the new `CheckIn` object exists and all its properties are set as expected.
    *   **Precondition Failures (`requires`):**
        *   **`owner exists`**: Attempt to submit with a non-existent `User` ID.
        *   **`each completed item belongs to ownerâ€™s active plan`**: Attempt to submit with a `PlanItem` that's either non-existent or owned by a different user.
        *   **`no check-in exists for (owner, date)`**: Submit a check-in, then try to submit another one for the exact same `owner` and `date`.
        *   **`strain_0_10` / `pain_0_10` range validation**: Test submitting values outside the 0-10 range (e.g., -1, 11) to confirm the concept rejects them (assuming this validation is part of the concept's behavior for "Number" in the 0-10 context).
        *   **Verification:** Each of these tests should result in an `error` being returned, and the concept's state should remain unchanged (no new check-in created).

3.  **`amend` Action Tests:**
    *   **Successful Amendments (Effects):**
        *   Test updating a single field (e.g., `comment`).
        *   Test updating multiple fields (e.g., `completedItems`, `strain_0_10`, `pain_0_10`).
        *   Test setting an optional field to `undefined` (or `null`) to confirm it can be cleared.
        *   **Verification:** Query the concept state after each `amend` call to confirm only the specified properties are updated, while others (like `owner`, `date`, and non-amended properties) remain unchanged.
    *   **Precondition Failures (`requires`):**
        *   **`checkin exists`**: Attempt to amend a `checkin` using a non-existent `checkinId`.
        *   **`each completed item belongs to ownerâ€™s active plan` (for `amend`)**: If `completedItems` are provided during amendment, ensure they still belong to the check-in's owner.
        *   **`strain_0_10` / `pain_0_10` range validation**: Test amending with values outside the 0-10 range.
        *   **Verification:** Each of these tests should result in an `error` being returned, and the concept's state for the target check-in should remain unchanged.

Each test step includes console output to describe the action, its results, and the verification of its effects, making the test trace legible as required. The `testDb` function is included as a placeholder, with the mock `CheckInConcept` standing in for the actual implementation for demonstration purposes.
