# prompt: make an outline for my RehabPlan concept implementation according to my specification:
[@checkIn-concept-specification](../../../src/concepts/RehabPlan/spec.md)


# response:

Here's the outline for your `RehabPlan` concept implementation, following the provided `Concept Design` specification and implementation guidelines.

---

### File structure and imports

```typescript
// file: src/RehabPlan/RehabPlanConcept.ts
import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";
import { Empty, ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import { freshID } from "@utils/database.ts"; // Utility to generate unique IDs
```

### Concept name prefix and generic type declarations

```typescript
// concept RehabPlan [User, Exercise]
// Purpose: Define the athleteâ€™s routine as a selection of exercises and target frequencies

// Declare collection prefix, using the concept name
const PREFIX = "RehabPlan" + ".";

// Generic types for the concept, treated as opaque IDs
type User = ID;
type Exercise = ID;

// Internal ID types for documents managed by this concept
type Plan = ID;      // ID for a Plan document
type PlanItem = ID;  // ID for a PlanItem document
```

### State interfaces

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a 'Plan' document in the database.
 * Corresponds to "a set of Plans with..." in the concept specification.
 *
 * @property _id The unique identifier for this plan.
 * @property owner The ID of the User who owns this plan.
 * @property archived Indicates if the plan is archived (default false).
 * @property items An array of PlanItem IDs associated with this plan.
 */
interface PlanDoc {
  _id: Plan;
  owner: User;
  archived: boolean;
  items: PlanItem[]; // References PlanItemDoc by ID
}

/**
 * Represents a 'PlanItem' document in the database.
 * Corresponds to "a set of PlanItems with..." in the concept specification.
 *
 * @property _id The unique identifier for this plan item.
 * @property planId The ID of the parent Plan this item belongs to.
 * @property exercise The ID of the Exercise associated with this item.
 * @property perWeek The target frequency per week for this exercise.
 * @property sets The target number of sets for this exercise.
 * @property reps The target number of repetitions per set for this exercise.
 * @property notes Any additional notes for this exercise in the plan.
 */

# prompt: is this an outline or an implementation?
# response:

This is an **implementation**, specifically a **skeleton implementation** or **scaffold**, rather than a high-level outline.

Here's why:

1.  **Concrete Code:** It uses actual TypeScript syntax for class definitions, interfaces, type declarations, method signatures, and even includes `async/await` for database operations.
2.  **Database Interactions:** It explicitly uses `Collection<PlanDoc>`, `this.db.collection(...)`, `freshID()`, `this.plans.findOne(...)`, `this.plans.insertOne(...)`, `this.plans.updateOne(...)`, `this.planItems.deleteOne(...)`, and `$push`/`$pull` operators for MongoDB. These are specific implementation details.
3.  **Logical Bodies:** The action methods (`createPlan`, `addPlanItem`, etc.) contain actual logic for checking preconditions (`if (existingActivePlan)`), creating new objects, inserting them into collections, and returning specific results or errors.
4.  **Error Handling:** It includes `return { error: "..." }` for specific error conditions, which is part of the implementation's behavior.

An "outline" would typically involve just the headings, type definitions (maybe without interfaces), and method signatures, with placeholder comments like `// TODO: Implement precondition check` and `// TODO: Implement state effects`, rather than the actual code to perform these steps.

You asked for an "outline for my RehabPlan concept implementation," and the response gave you a very detailed, code-centric "implementation outline" or a "code scaffold," which is often more useful in practice for starting development.

# prompt: what is left to implement
# response:

You've done an excellent job of creating a robust skeleton implementation! Most of the core logic for the actions and state management is already in place.

Here's a breakdown of what's left to implement, categorized for clarity:

### 1. External Precondition Enforcement (Via Syncs/Caller)

This is a crucial point regarding concept independence, as per the documentation: "Perhaps the most significant distinguishing feature of concepts... is their mutual independence. Each concept is defined without reference to any other concepts, and can be understood in isolation."

*   **`addPlanItem` action:**
    *   **`requires exercise exists and deprecated = false`**: As per concept design principles, your `RehabPlanConcept` should *not* directly query an `Exercise` concept to check this. This precondition is the responsibility of the system or other concepts (e.g., an `Exercise` concept) to ensure, usually through a **synchronization** (sync) rule or by the calling context. The `RehabPlanConcept` assumes that the `Exercise` ID provided is valid and non-deprecated. If you wanted to enforce this, a sync would look something like:
        ```
        sync CheckExerciseForPlanItem
        when
            RehabPlan.addPlanItem (plan, exercise, ...)
        where
            // Check in Exercise concept if exercise exists and is not deprecated
            in Exercise: exists (exercise) and not isDeprecated (exercise)
        then
            // If the where clause fails, the `when` action wouldn't proceed,
            // or an explicit error sync could be created.
            // (Note: Syncs are usually for *causing* actions, not preventing,
            // so this usually means the *caller* must ensure this, or a higher-level
            // orchestrator/sync layer prevents invalid calls.)
        ```
        **What to do:** Acknowledge this in comments, but **do not add internal code** to `RehabPlanConcept` to query an `Exercise` concept.

*   **`createPlan` action:**
    *   **`requires owner exists`**: Similar to the `Exercise` existence, `RehabPlanConcept` doesn't own `User` entities. The assumption is that the `owner` ID refers to a valid user managed by another concept (e.g., `UserAuthentication` or `UserProfile`). This would also be enforced by a sync or the caller.
        **What to do:** Acknowledge this in comments, but **do not add internal code** to `RehabPlanConcept` to query a `User` concept.

### 2. Missing Core Functionality (Based on Principle/Purpose)

The current actions cover defining the plan, but the principle states: "the plan enumerates plan items that can be logged each day". This implies functionality related to the *daily logging* of exercises against the plan.

*   **Logging Plan Items:** There are no actions for users to "log" that they completed a `PlanItem` on a given day. This would likely involve:
    *   An action to `logActivity` for a specific `PlanItem` (and possibly `User` and `date`).
    *   This would likely involve another concept (`DailyLog` or similar) or an expansion of `RehabPlan` to track daily completions.
    *   This is a significant feature gap for fulfilling the concept's purpose and principle.

### 3. Query Expansion

The example queries are good, but a full implementation would likely need more to support common UI/reporting needs:

*   `_getPlanItemsDetailsForPlan`: A query that returns `PlanItemDoc`s and potentially joins/fetches details from the `Exercise` concept (again, likely via a sync that combines data from `RehabPlan` and `Exercise` concepts).
*   `_getAllPlansForUser`: Get all plans (active and archived) for a given user.
*   `_getArchivedPlansForUser`: Get only archived plans for a user.
*   `_getPlanItemById`: Retrieve a single `PlanItemDoc` by its ID.

### 4. Robustness and Refinements

*   **Input Validation:** While types (`string`, `number`) are enforced by TypeScript, you might want more granular validation (e.g., `perWeek`, `sets`, `reps` must be positive integers; `notes` length limits). This is often handled at an API layer or within the action if it's critical business logic.
*   **Concurrency:** For complex operations that modify multiple documents (e.g., `addPlanItem` updates `planItems` and `plans`), MongoDB's update operations are often atomic at the document level. For multi-document, multi-collection operations where atomicity is critical, you might consider explicit [MongoDB Transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/) (though your current pattern of `$push` is usually sufficient and atomic for that specific update).
*   **Indexing:** For performance, you'd want to ensure appropriate indexes are created on your MongoDB collections (e.g., on `owner` in `plans`, on `planId` and `exercise` in `planItems`).
*   **Error Handling Details:** The current error messages are functional. For a production system, you might want to standardize error codes or provide more detailed diagnostics.

### Summary of what's "left"

1.  **Acknowledge External Preconditions:** Add comments to `createPlan` and `addPlanItem` explaining that `owner exists` and `exercise exists/not deprecated` are assumed to be handled by syncs or the calling context, not within this concept.
2.  **Implement Daily Logging Functionality:** This is the biggest missing piece related to the `Principle`. You'd need new actions and potentially new state (or even a new concept) to track daily exercise completions.
3.  **Expand Query Set:** Add more queries to support common data retrieval needs for the application.
4.  **Refine Input Validation and Error Handling:** Add more specific validation for numeric inputs and potentially refine error messages.
5.  **Add Database Indexing (Configuration):** Not code, but a deployment concern for performance.

The foundation you've built is very strong, correctly adhering to the concept design principles!
