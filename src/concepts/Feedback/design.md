Changed: 
The original `Feedback` specification was refactored to more strictly adhere to the principles of concept design, primarily by enforcing complete independence and eliminating composite objects from action interfaces. The most critical change involved moving the complex conditional logic for triggering a reminder out of the `sendReminder` action's precondition and into the `where` clause of the `dailyReminder` sync. This ensures that the `Feedback` concept itself has no direct knowledge of or dependency on the state of other concepts like `User` or `CheckIn`. Additionally, actions like `recompute` were modified to return primitive identifiers and values (e.g., `summaryId`, `newStreakCount`) instead of composite objects, which simplifies the consuming syncs. Finally, explicit queries were added to provide a formal, controlled way for syncs to read `Feedback`'s state, and internal state was added to make the concept more behaviorally complete.
Interesting moments:
2.5 pro gave each test area its own deno.test, 2.5 flash gave them all as one deno.test with multiple steps
