# response:

Yes, using multiple `Deno.test` blocks absolutely fits the instructions, and in fact, it's generally a *better* approach that adheres more closely to the spirit of the guidelines than putting everything in a single `Deno.test` block.

Let's break down why, based on the provided instructions:

1. **"Use the Deno.test framework, splitting by appropriate test steps and describing each behavior."**
   * This is the most direct justification. Each `Deno.test` block *is* an "appropriate test step" designed to describe and verify a specific "behavior."
   * If you put *all* cases (principle, 3-5 scenarios) into one `Deno.test`, you're not truly "splitting by appropriate test steps" within the framework's structure. You'd be splitting logically *inside* one large test, but the Deno test runner would still see it as a single unit, making individual failures harder to isolate.

2. **"Each test should output what it is doing and the trace of any actions..."**
   * When you have separate `Deno.test` blocks, the output for each scenario is naturally grouped and labeled by Deno's test runner. This makes it much easier to read the "trace of any actions" for a specific scenario without it getting intermingled with unrelated actions from other scenarios within the same large test block.

3. **"Principle tests and tests involving multiple actions should explain how it aligns with expectations."**
   * A dedicated `Deno.test` block titled "FeedbackConcept: Operational Principle Trace" (as in the example) allows for a clear, focused explanation of how *that specific sequence* aligns with the principle, without distractions from other unrelated tests.

4. **"For action tests, the output should explain how requirements are met and how effects are confirmed."**
   * Again, separating tests by scenario (e.g., "recompute handles creation and updates," "sendReminder fails if no summary exists") allows you to precisely explain the requirements and effects *for that specific test's focus*.

5. **"Number required. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios."**
   * This requirement specifies *what* to test, not *how* to structure your Deno test file. Having one `Deno.test` for the principle and separate `Deno.test` blocks for each of the 3-5 interesting scenarios (or logical groupings of them) is a perfectly valid and often preferred way to fulfill this.

**In summary:**

While a single `Deno.test` could technically contain all your assertions, using multiple `Deno.test` blocks, one for the operational principle and one or more for "interesting scenarios," aligns *much better* with the "legible testing" goals and the instruction to "split by appropriate test steps." It makes your test suite clearer, more modular, easier to debug, and its output more understandable.

Your provided test suite, with its distinct `Deno.test` blocks for the principle and various scenarios, is an excellent implementation of these guidelines.
