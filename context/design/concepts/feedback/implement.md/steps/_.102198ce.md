# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

**concept** Feedback \[User, CheckIn]

**purpose** Compute and deliver habit-forming feedback and reminders from check-ins

**principle** As the athlete logs check-ins, the system computes streaks and completion rates; at a configured reminder time, if the day’s check-in is missing, send a reminder.

**state**
  a set of Summaries with
    owner User
    streakCount Number
    completion7d Ratio
lastReminderDate Date // To prevent multiple reminders on the same day

  a set of Messages with
    owner User
    timestamp DateTime
    kind {reminder, motivation, summary}
    text String

**actions**

* recompute (owner: User, today: Date) : (summaryId: Summary, newStreakCount: Number, newCompletion7d: Ratio)
      **requires** owner exists
      **effects**
  upserts owner’s Summary;
  sets its streakCount to `newStreakCount` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
  sets its completion7d to `newCompletion7d` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
  returns the ID of the updated/created Summary along with the computed streak and completion values.

* recordMessage (owner: User, kind: Enum, text: String) : (messageId: Message)
      **requires** owner exists
      **effects**
  appends a new Message for `owner` with the given `kind` and `text` at the current timestamp for audit/tracking;
  returns the ID of the new Message.

* **system** sendReminder (owner: User)
      **requires** owner exists
      **effects**
  delivers an out-of-band reminder to `owner`;
  records a reminder Message for `owner`;
  updates `owner`'s Summary to set `lastReminderDate` to today's date to track that a reminder was sent.

**queries**

* \_getSummaryMetrics (owner: User) : (streakCount: Number, completion7d: Ratio)
      **requires** in Feedback: Summary of owner exists
      **effects** returns the `streakCount` and `completion7d` from the `owner`'s Summary.

* \_hasSentReminderToday (owner: User, date: Date) : (sent: Boolean)
      **requires** in Feedback: Summary of owner exists
      **effects** returns `true` if the `owner`'s `lastReminderDate` in their Summary is `date`, `false` otherwise.

**syncs**

* computeFeedback
      **when** CheckIn.submit (owner: User, date: Date, /\* other check-in args \*/)
      **where**
        in CheckIn: \_calculateStreak (user: owner, tillDate: date) is calculatedStreak // Assumes CheckIn concept provides a query for calculating streak
        in CheckIn: \_calculateCompletion7d (user: owner, tillDate: date) is calculatedCompletion // Assumes CheckIn concept provides a query for calculating 7-day completion
      **then** Feedback.recompute (owner: owner, today: date) : (summaryId, newStreakCount, newCompletion7d)
      **then** newStreakCount is calculatedStreak
      **then** newCompletion7d is calculatedCompletion

* motivateOnImprovement
      **when** Feedback.recompute (owner, today) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
      **where** currentStreak > 0
      **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: owner, kind: motivation, text: "Nice work — streak " + currentStreak + " days!")

* dailyReminder
      **when** Schedule.hourlyTick (currentDateTime: DateTime) // Assumes a `Schedule` concept providing hourly ticks
      **where**
        in User: user of u, reminderTime of u is rTime // Assumes `User` concept has a `reminderTime` property for `User` entities
        currentDateTime.time is after rTime.time // Comparing only the time component
        currentDateTime.date is todayDate
        in CheckIn: \_hasCheckIn (user: u, date: todayDate) is false // Assumes `CheckIn` concept has a query to check for check-ins
        in Feedback: \_hasSentReminderToday (owner: u, date: todayDate) is false
      **then** Feedback.sendReminder (owner: u)

* shareOpen
      **when** User.createShareLink (user: User) : (token: String) // Assumes `User` concept for share link creation
      **where** token exists
      **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: user, kind: summary, text: "Share link created; weekly summary visible via link.")

* weeklySummary
      **when** Calendar.endsWeek (weekEndDate: Date) // Assumes a `Calendar` concept that triggers at week end
      **where** user: User // This implies the sync iterates for all relevant users, or `Calendar.endsWeek` provides context
      **then** Feedback.recompute (owner: user, today: weekEndDate) : (summaryId, currentStreak, currentCompletion)
      **then** Feedback.recordMessage (owner: user, kind: summary, text: "Weekly: " + currentCompletion\*100 + "% complete.")
