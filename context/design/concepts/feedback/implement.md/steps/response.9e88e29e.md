   * **requires** owner exists
   *
   * **effects**
   * upserts ownerâ€™s Summary;
   * sets its streakCount to `newStreakCount` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
   * sets its completion7d to `newCompletion7d` (derived from recent CheckIns, based on the `CheckIn` concept's state, evaluated by the triggering sync);
   * returns the ID of the updated/created Summary along with the computed streak and completion values.
   *
   * @param params An object containing:
   *   `owner`: The ID of the user whose summary is being recomputed.
   *   `today`: The current date for context.
   *   `newStreakCount`: The computed streak count, provided by the triggering sync.
   *   `newCompletion7d`: The computed 7-day completion ratio, provided by the triggering sync.
   * @returns A promise resolving to an object with `summaryId`, `newStreakCount`, and `newCompletion7d` on success,
   *          or an `{ error: string }` object if preconditions are not met or an error occurs.
