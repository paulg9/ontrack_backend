# response:

The prevailing scientific theory for the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs (and about 75% of all species on Earth) about **66 million years ago** is a catastrophic event known as the **Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event**.

Here's a breakdown of the leading hypothesis:

1. **Asteroid Impact:**
   * **The Event:** A massive asteroid, estimated to be about 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) wide, struck the Earth in what is now the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. This impact created the **Chicxulub crater**.
   * **Immediate Effects:**
     * **Massive Explosion:** The impact released energy equivalent to billions of atomic bombs, creating a colossal explosion.
     * **Shockwaves & Tsunamis:** Devastating shockwaves ripped through the ground, and enormous tsunamis (hundreds of meters high) swept across coastlines worldwide.
     * **Heat Pulse & Wildfires:** A superheated cloud of ejecta (vaporized rock, dust, and debris) was launched into the atmosphere. As this material fell back to Earth, it caused a global pulse of intense radiant heat, triggering widespread wildfires across continents. Soot and smoke from these fires further filled the atmosphere.

2. **Long-Term Environmental Catastrophe (The "Impact Winter"):**
   * **Global Darkness:** The dust, soot, and aerosols launched into the atmosphere blocked out the sun for months, or even years, plunging the Earth into a period of prolonged darkness.
   * **Collapse of Photosynthesis:** Without sunlight, plants (the base of most food chains) could not photosynthesize. This led to a rapid and widespread collapse of ecosystems.
   * **Global Cooling:** The lack of sunlight caused a drastic drop in global temperatures, leading to a long "impact winter."
   * **Acid Rain:** Vaporized sulfur-rich rock from the impact site mixed with atmospheric water, creating widespread acid rain, further devastating plant life and aquatic ecosystems.

**Why Dinosaurs Were Particularly Vulnerable:**

* **Large Size:** Many non-avian dinosaurs were large and required vast amounts of food, which quickly disappeared.
* **Specialized Diets:** Many were herbivores (relying on specific plants) or carnivores (relying on herbivores), making them vulnerable to the food chain collapse.
* **Slow Reproduction/Growth:** Compared to smaller, faster-reproducing animals, they couldn't adapt quickly enough to the rapid environmental changes.

**Other Contributing Factors (Though the Asteroid is Key):**

While the asteroid is considered the primary trigger, other factors might have pre-stressed Earth's ecosystems, making them more vulnerable:

* **Massive Volcanic Activity:** The **Deccan Traps** in India experienced massive volcanic eruptions around the same time. These eruptions released huge amounts of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, potentially causing long-term climate change and ocean acidification *before* the asteroid, further stressing ecosystems. Some scientists believe the volcanism weakened Earth's biota, making the asteroid's impact even more devastating, while others suggest the asteroid impact might have even *triggered* intensified volcanism.
* **Gradual Climate Change:** Earth's climate was already undergoing changes prior to the K-Pg event, which might have made some species less resilient.

**Who Survived?**

Animals that could survive on less food, were smaller, could burrow, or had more adaptable diets (like scavengers or omnivores) tended to survive. This includes many mammals, birds (avian dinosaurs), crocodiles, turtles, snakes, lizards, fish, amphibians, and insects.

**In summary, the consensus is that a single, devastating asteroid impact triggered a chain of catastrophic environmental events – global darkness, widespread wildfires, massive tsunamis, acid rain, and prolonged global cooling – that ultimately led to the mass extinction, wiping out the non-avian dinosaurs and many other life forms.**
