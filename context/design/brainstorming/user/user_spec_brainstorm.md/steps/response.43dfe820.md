# response:

Here is the specification for your `UserAccount` concept, formatted as it would appear in a `spec.md` file, incorporating the consolidation discussed and pragmatic compromises.

***

**Note:** This `UserAccount` concept represents a pragmatic consolidation of user identity, personal preferences, and sharing features under a single "account management" umbrella. While Concept Design typically advocates for more granular separation (e.g., `UserAuthentication`, `UserNotificationPreferences`, `ShareableLinks` as distinct concepts), this approach balances that ideal with the desire to limit the number of concepts, treating these functionalities as core, self-managed aspects of a user's presence within the application.
