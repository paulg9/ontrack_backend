# Concept Design Background

Concept design organizes software into concepts, which are independent and familiar units of functionality with a single purpose. A concept specification contains:

* **concept**: a descriptive name balancing generality of use and appropriate specificity
* **purpose**: the reason for why this concept exists, and what it enables
* **principle**: a motivating scenario that establishes how the concept achieves its purpose
* **state**: a simple state modeling language meant to capture the basic relationships between the necessary information
* **actions**: a set of events that (largely) mutate the state or update represented information, written as a set of pre/postconditions: what the action **requires** in order to occur, and what **effects** it has

Concepts are uniquely motivated by the fact that they are:

1. Completely independent of one another in terms of dependencies and state.
2. Work off generic parameters, and cannot know about specific types.
3. Strongly grounded in a user-relevant purpose, and not just a structure for software.

**concept** UserAccount

**purpose** To enable the creation, management, and personalization of a user's account within the application.

**principle** An athlete registers for an account, personalizes their notification reminder time, and can generate or revoke temporary share links to their data, all managed through their account.

**state**

* a set of Users with
  * `username String`
  * `passwordHash String`
  * `reminderTime TimeOfDay`
  * `shareLinks set of ShareLink`
* a set of ShareLinks with
  * `token String`
  * `expiry DateTime`
  * `owner User`

**actions**

* `register (username: String, password: String) : (user: User)`
  * **requires** `username` is not already taken
  * **effects** creates a new `User`, assigns the provided `username` and `passwordHash` (of the `password`), sets `reminderTime` to a default value (e.g., null), and initializes `shareLinks` as an empty set.

* `setReminderTime (user: User, time: TimeOfDay)`
  * **requires** `user` exists
  * **effects** sets `user.reminderTime := time`

* `createShareLink (owner: User, ttlSeconds: Number) : (token: String)`
  * **requires** `owner` exists
  * **effects** creates a new `ShareLink` with a randomly generated `token`, sets `expiry = now + ttlSeconds`, associates `owner` with the provided `User`, and adds this `ShareLink` to `owner.shareLinks`.

* `revokeShareLink (owner: User, token: String)`
  * **requires** a `ShareLink` exists with the given `token` and its `owner` is the provided `owner`
  * **effects** removes the `ShareLink` with the specified `token` from `owner.shareLinks` and deletes the `ShareLink` itself.
