# Concept Design Background

Concept design organizes software into concepts, which are independent and familiar units of functionality with a single purpose. A concept specification contains:

* **concept**: a descriptive name balancing generality of use and appropriate specificity
* **purpose**: the reason for why this concept exists, and what it enables
* **principle**: a motivating scenario that establishes how the concept achieves its purpose
* **state**: a simple state modeling language meant to capture the basic relationships between the necessary information
* **actions**: a set of events that (largely) mutate the state or update represented information, written as a set of pre/postconditions: what the action **requires** in order to occur, and what **effects** it has

Concepts are uniquely motivated by the fact that they are:

1. Completely independent of one another in terms of dependencies and state.
2. Work off generic parameters, and cannot know about specific types.
3. Strongly grounded in a user-relevant purpose, and not just a structure for software.

## Concept: User

**Purpose** Represent an athleteâ€™s identity, notification preferences, and read-only sharing

**Principle** An athlete creates an account, sets a reminder time, and (optionally) creates share links so others can view summaries without modifying data

**State**

* a set of Users with
  * reminderTime TimeOfDay
  * shareLinks set of ShareLink
* a set of ShareLinks with
  * token String
  * expiry DateTime

**Actions**

* register () : (user: User)
  * requires n/a
  * effects creates a new user with default reminderTime and no shareLinks

* setReminderTime (user: User, time: TimeOfDay)
  * requires user exists
  * effects sets user.reminderTime := time

* createShareLink (user: User, ttlSeconds: Number) : (token: String)
  * requires user exists
  * effects creates a ShareLink with random token and expiry = now + ttlSeconds; adds it to user.shareLinks

* revokeShareLink (user: User, token: String)
  * requires a share link with token exists for user
  * effects removes that link from user.shareLinks
