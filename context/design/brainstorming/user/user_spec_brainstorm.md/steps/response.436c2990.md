# response:

The `User` concept was **renamed to `UserAccount`** to better reflect its role as a manager of user-related features rather than simply representing a user entity. The **purpose was refined** to encompass "creation, management, and personalization of a user's account," aiming to pragmatically consolidate user identity/authentication, notification preferences, and sharing link functionalities under a single, broader but cohesive scope. Additionally, the **state declaration for `Users` was made more explicit** by including `username String` and `passwordHash String` to clearly support the `register` action, and `owner User` in `ShareLinks` was clarified for better state modeling. The actions themselves remained the same, reflecting a strategic decision to bundle these functionalities into one concept despite the ideal of more granular separation.
