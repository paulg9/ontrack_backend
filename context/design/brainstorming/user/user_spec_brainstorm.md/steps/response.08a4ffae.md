# response:

The primary change involved refining the concept's identity and scope to accommodate multiple user-related functionalities under a single umbrella. The concept name was updated from `User` to `UserAccount` to better reflect its role as a manager of various account aspects, rather than representing a user entity itself. Concurrently, the **purpose** was broadened to "enable the creation, management, and personalization of a user's account," providing a cohesive rationale for including identity management, personal preferences (like `reminderTime`), and resource sharing (`shareLinks`) within this single concept. This adjustment represents a pragmatic consolidation, balancing the strict separation of concerns advocated by Concept Design with the desire to limit the overall number of concepts.
